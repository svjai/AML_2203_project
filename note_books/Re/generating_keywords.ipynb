      "Book: Learning Go by Jon Bodner, Description: Go has rapidly become the preferred language for building web services. Plenty of tutorials are available to teach Go's syntax to developers with experience in other programming languages, but tutorials aren't enough. They don't teach Go's idioms, so developers end up recreating patterns that don't make sense in a Go context. This practical guide provides the essential background you need to write clear and idiomatic Go.No matter your level of experience, you'll learn how to think like a Go developer. Author Jon Bodner introduces the design patterns experienced Go developers have adopted and explores the rationale for using them. This updated edition also shows you how Go's generics support fits into the language.This book helps you:Write idiomatic code in Go and design a Go projectUnderstand the reasons behind Go's design decisionsSet up a Go development environment for a solo developer or teamLearn how and when to use reflection, unsafe, and cgoDiscover how Go's features allow the language to run efficientlyKnow which Go features you should use sparingly or not at allUse Go's tools to improve performance, optimize memory usage, and reduce garbage collectionLearn how to use Go's advanced development tools\n",
      "Book: Tidy First? by Kent Beck, Description: Tidying up messy software is a must. And that means breaking up the code to make it more readable, and using guard clauses and helping functions to make it understandable. In this practical guide, author Kent Beck, creator of Extreme Programming and pioneer of software patterns, suggests when and where you might apply tidyings in your code.Instead of trying to master tidying all at once, this book lets you try out a few examples that make sense for your problem. If you have a big function containing many lines of code, you'll learn how to logically divide it into smaller chunks. Along the way, you'll learn the theory behind software design: coupling, cohesion, discounted cash flows, and optionality.\n",
      "Book: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron, Description: Through a recent series of breakthroughs, deep learning has boosted the entire field of machine learning. Now, even programmers who know close to nothing about this technology can use simple, efficient tools to implement programs capable of learning from data. This bestselling book uses concrete examples, minimal theory, and production-ready Python frameworks (Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow) to help you gain an intuitive understanding of the concepts and tools for building intelligent systems.With this updated third edition, author Aurélien Géron explores a range of techniques, starting with simple linear regression and progressing to deep neural networks. Numerous code examples and exercises throughout the book help you apply what you've learned. Programming experience is all you need to get started.Use Scikit-learn to track an example ML project end to endExplore several models, including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and ensemble methodsExploit unsupervised learning techniques such as dimensionality reduction, clustering, and anomaly detectionDive into neural net architectures, including convolutional nets, recurrent nets, generative adversarial networks, autoencoders, diffusion models, and transformersUse TensorFlow and Keras to build and train neural nets for computer vision, natural language processing, generative models, and deep reinforcement learning\n",
      "Book: Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann, Description: Data is at the center of many challenges in system design today. Difficult issues need to be figured out, such as scalability, consistency, reliability, efficiency, and maintainability. In addition, we have an overwhelming variety of tools, including relational databases, NoSQL datastores, stream or batch processors, and message brokers. What are the right choices for your application? How do you make sense of all these buzzwords?In this practical and comprehensive guide, author Martin Kleppmann helps you navigate this diverse landscape by examining the pros and cons of various technologies for processing and storing data. Software keeps changing, but the fundamental principles remain the same.
